            <h3>Background and Interests</h3>

                <p>Born in New Delhi, India, I came to the U.S. in the early 90s.  My parents, siblings, and I have lived in the DMV area ever since.  
                I also completed all my schooling locally.
                </p>

                <p>I am an avid practitioner of Yoga and Meditation and enjoy reading up on the subject during my free time.  
                I developed this interest after a friend pointed me towards them during a difficult time in my life and I’ve been hooked ever since given how much it helped me.  
                Using what I learn during the boot camp, I would like to create a website where I can share my development as a Yoga practitioner and share some tips or materials on Meditation. 
                </p>

            <h3>Career</h3>
                
                <p>My career started off in the mortgage industry and I have stayed in it the entire time.  
                I am a senior valuation analyst and my expertise include, but not limited to, the valuation of Mortgaged Backed Securities (MBS) of various types including structured and non-structured products.  
                I’ve always had an analytical mindset and been interested in data analytics, so my current job suits my interests.
                </p>
                
                <p>My job required the use of various tools such as MS Office Suite, Bloomberg, Intex, and Tableau to name a few.  
                Being in a senior and leadership role, I am also involved in various initiatives related to the future state of our organization.  
                I’m also an active member of the Diversity and Inclusion, D and I, committee in our organization as I believe equal opportunity and fair treatment at work is a must for all.
